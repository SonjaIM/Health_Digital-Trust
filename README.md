# On Social Costs of Data Sovereignty and Data-Driven Decision-Making. The Case of Health and Digital Trust

Sonja MÃ¼ller

Abstract

Background: This paper aims to explore the relationship between health and digital trust. Increasing digitalization raises the question of appropriate governance rules for data sharing. The combination of data sovereignty and data-based decision-making can be detrimental if certain population groups structurally decide against sharing data. It is argued that health is closely linked to the perception of one's own vulnerability. The hypothesis presented in this paper, therefore, suggests that poor health leads to lower levels of digital trust. The study mainly draws on data from round 10 of the European Social Survey. Multiple linear regression is used to examine the relationship between health and three digital trust-related variables.

Results: The findings support the hypothesis, indicating that people feeling particularly hindered by their health in everyday life have lower levels of digital trust. Although health has the strongest effect, slightly negative correlations can be observed for greater use of digital sources, better education, and less corruption.

Conclusion: The results imply that individual decisions on selective data sharing are likely to structurally skew health-related data. All data-based activities, such as research or politics, must consider these emerging biases, and solutions must be found to counter this issue.
